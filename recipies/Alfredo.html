    flavorful and garlicy it will make your mouth water. So quit wasting your money on 
    jared sauce or going to a restaurant where the sauce is frozen and just reheated.
    Also kick your diet out the door because this is filled with butter and is not 
    healthy in anyway. So what are you waiting for , start cooking!   </p1>

<h3> Steps</h3>
<ol> 
<li>    Prepare the chicken. Use a sharp knife to slice each chicken breast in half horizontally, 
        to create a thin cutlet. Start at the thick edge of the chicken breast. See photos. 
        You should end up with 4 thin pieces of chicken that are the same shape as a chicken 
        breast, just thinner.
</li>

<li>    In a small bowl, combine 1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1/4 
        teaspoon smoked paprika. Pat the chicken with paper towels on both sides until it 
        is very dry. Sprinkle the spice mixture all over the chicken on both sides, and rub in.
</li>

<li>    In a 12-inch saute pan over medium high heat for at least 3 minutes. 
        When it is hot, add 2 tablespoons oil. Swirl to coat. The oil should shimmer right away.
</li>

<li>    Carefully place the chicken in the pan. Once it touches the pan you can't move it, 
        so arrange accordingly. Do not crowd the chicken. If your pan isn't big enough, do it 
        in batches. Do not touch, poke, or move the chicken at all. It needs to 
        stay put to get a nice sear.
</li>

<li>    Once all the chicken is in the pan, lower the heat to medium. Cook the 
        chicken for 3-4 minutes. If you try to flip the chicken and it sticks to 
        the pan, it's not ready to turn.
</li>

<li>    Use tongs to flip each piece of chicken, swirling the pan as necessary 
        to coat with oil. Immediately add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and swirl 
        the pan as it melts. (The butter helps the chicken to brown, and brings flavor.)
        Cook the chicken on the second side for about 2 minutes, until the other side is 
        a deep golden brown and a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Remove the 
        chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm. Leave all juices in the pan. 
        (Turn the heat off if you're not ready to make the sauce yet)
</li>

<li>    Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine. Fill a 3 quart pot with water. Add 1 
        tablespoon kosher salt and bring to a boil over high heat. When it is 
        at a rolling boil, add 12 ounces of fettuccine. Stir occasionally so the 
        noodles don't stick to each other. Cook for about 10 minutes, until the
        noodles are al dente (don't over cook!) Drain the noodles, but be sure to 
        save about a cup of the pasta water. Set it aside in a small bowl. Then add a 
        drizzle of olive oil to the noodles and stir so that they don't stick to each
        other. Set aside.
</li>

<li>    Make the alfredo sauce. In the same pan that you cooked the chicken in, 
        add 3/4 cup butter (1 and 1/2 sticks) over medium heat. Let it melt and bubble
        a bit (don't let it brown), then add 5 cloves of smashed and minced garlic. 
        Saute the garlic for 1 minute until fragrant.
</li>
<li>    Slowly add 2 cups of cream while stirring. Take your time. Add 1 and 1/4 
        teaspoons kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
        , and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg.
</li>

<li>    Let the cream mixture cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes until 
        you see gentle bubbles on the side of the pan. Do not bring to a full boil; 
        your sauce will break (meaning it will look curdled instead of smooth). 
        Lower the heat to medium low.
</li>

<li>    Finely shred 1 and 1/2 cups parmesan cheese using the finest grater. 
        I do not recommend using pre shredded parmesan (and definitely not the powdered stuff). 
        Pre-grated cheese will not melt as well, and your sauce will be clumpy.
</li>

<li>    Add the cheese to the sauce just a few tablespoons at a time. Sprinkle some 
        in and stir for a bit to help it melt, then add a bit more cheese, stir, etc. 
        This will help the cheese to melt more thoroughly, making a smooth sauce.
</li>

<li>    Once all the cheese is added in, taste the sauce and adjust seasonings as you like.
</li>

<li>    Add the noodles in batches so that it all gets coated well in sauce. 
        Add in about 1/3, stir to coat, the next 1/3, and so on.
</li>

<li>    Use a sharp serrated knife to slice the chicken into strips 
        against the grain. You can either plate the pasta and arrange the 
        chicken on top to serve, or add the chicken to the pasta in the pan and stir it all together.
</li>

<li>    If you have a wait a few minutes before serving, keep the heat on low and cover. 
        The sauce will continue to thicken as it sits, so to loosen it just before serving, 
        add the reserved pasta water a couple tablespoons at a time, stirring well.
</li>

<li>    Top each serving with extra parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley!
